    "Extended thinking is a powerful feature that gives LLMs like Claude Sonnet enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks by allowing it to work through problems step-by-step before delivering a final answer. When extended thinking is enabled, Claude creates internal reasoning blocks where it outputs its thought process, then incorporates insights from this reasoning to craft a more thoughtful final response. \n",

    "The main difference you'll notice with the interleaved thinking is that Event loop is acting on LLM's \"thoughts\", rather than \"decisions\".  In a traditional event loop, the thoughts are hidden. We have to wait until LLM renders either a decision to call a tool or produces the Final Answer. \n",
    "\n",

What this means is that by the time LLM is done thinking, it actually has the Final Answer, on the very first \"decision\". "

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists represent a class of medications that have transformed the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. These drugs, including semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy), liraglutide (Victoza, Saxenda), dulaglutide (Trulicity), and tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound), work by mimicking the incretin hormone GLP-1 to regulate blood glucose and promote satiety. As these medications are increasingly prescribed for chronic conditions requiring long-term treatment, understanding their safety and efficacy profiles over extended periods becomes critical for clinical decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-term use in clinical research typically refers to treatment periods extending beyond two years, with some studies following patients for up to five years or more. The growing body of evidence from cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), extension studies, and real-world data provides valuable insights into the sustained benefits and potential risks of chronic GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Long-Term Safety Profile\n",
      "\n",
      "The safety profile of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been extensively studied through large-scale cardiovascular outcome trials and post-marketing surveillance programs. The most comprehensive safety data comes from trials such as SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide), LEADER (liraglutide), and REWIND (dulaglutide), which followed patients for 2-5 years. These studies consistently demonstrate that GLP-1 receptor agonists have a generally favorable long-term safety profile, with most adverse events being mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms that tend to diminish over time (Marso et al., 2016; Gerstein et al., 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common long-term adverse effects include persistent gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which occur in approximately 20-40% of patients but typically decrease in severity with continued use. More serious safety concerns that have emerged from long-term studies include potential associations with acute pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, and diabetic retinopathy complications. The incidence of acute pancreatitis remains low (approximately 0.1-0.2% annually) but represents a clinically significant risk requiring monitoring (Faillie et al., 2022). Gallbladder-related events, including cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, occur more frequently than pancreatitis but are generally manageable with appropriate clinical surveillance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of particular interest is the long-term cardiovascular safety profile, which has proven to be not just neutral but beneficial. Major cardiovascular outcome trials have demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.74 to 0.87 compared to placebo. These cardiovascular benefits appear to be sustained throughout the treatment period and may even improve with longer exposure, suggesting that extended use provides cumulative protective effects rather than increased risks (Kristensen et al., 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Sustained Efficacy for Weight Management and Glycemic Control\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-term effectiveness data for GLP-1 receptor agonists demonstrate sustained benefits for both weight management and glycemic control, though with some variability between individuals and drug formulations. Clinical trials with follow-up periods extending to 3-4 years show that patients typically maintain 60-80% of their initial weight loss, with average sustained weight reductions ranging from 5-15% depending on the specific medication and dosing regimen. The STEP extension trials for semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated maintained weight loss of approximately 15% at 104 weeks, while the SCALE extension study for liraglutide showed sustained 6-8% weight reduction over four years (Wilding et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Glycemic control benefits also demonstrate durability over extended treatment periods. Long-term studies show sustained HbA1c reductions of 1.0-2.0% that persist throughout treatment, with many patients maintaining target glycemic levels without requiring additional diabetes medications. The effectiveness appears to be maintained even as beta-cell function continues to decline over time, suggesting that the multiple mechanisms of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists provide sustained therapeutic benefit. However, individual responses vary considerably, with approximately 10-20% of patients experiencing diminished effectiveness over time, necessitating dose adjustments or combination therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The durability of effects is closely linked to treatment adherence, as discontinuation typically results in gradual return to baseline weight and glycemic levels within 6-12 months. This highlights the chronic nature of the conditions being treated and the need for long-term therapeutic commitment. Real-world studies suggest that patients who continue treatment beyond two years are more likely to maintain sustained benefits, indicating that longer treatment periods may optimize outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk-Benefit Considerations and Clinical Monitoring\n",
      "\n",
      "The accumulated evidence from long-term studies supports a favorable risk-benefit profile for GLP-1 receptor agonists when used chronically in appropriate patient populations. The cardiovascular protective effects, sustained weight loss, and durable glycemic control benefits generally outweigh the risks of gastrointestinal side effects and relatively low-frequency serious adverse events. However, successful long-term use requires careful patient selection, appropriate monitoring protocols, and individualized treatment approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key considerations for long-term safety monitoring include regular assessment for signs of pancreatitis, particularly during the first few months of treatment, periodic evaluation of gallbladder function in high-risk patients, and ophthalmologic monitoring in patients with diabetes who may be at increased risk for retinopathy progression. The potential for drug interactions and the need for dose adjustments of concurrent medications, particularly insulin and sulfonylureas, also require ongoing clinical attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Current evidence strongly supports the safety and effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists for long-term use in appropriate patient populations. The cardiovascular outcome trials and extension studies demonstrate that these medications not only maintain their therapeutic benefits over extended periods but may provide cumulative advantages, particularly for cardiovascular protection. While certain risks exist, including gastrointestinal adverse effects and low-frequency serious events such as pancreatitis, the overall risk-benefit profile favors long-term use for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity who respond well to initial treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to successful long-term GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy lies in appropriate patient selection, comprehensive pre-treatment evaluation, and ongoing clinical monitoring. As real-world experience continues to accumulate and longer-term follow-up data become available, our understanding of the optimal approaches to chronic GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy will continue to evolve. For now, the evidence supports their use as safe and effective long-term therapeutic options for managing chronic metabolic diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin secretory molecule. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) due to their attributes such as body weight loss, protection of islet β cells, promotion of islet β cell proliferation and minimal side effects. Studies have found that GLP-1R is widely distributed on pancreatic and other tissues and has multiple biological effects, such as reducing neuroinflammation, promoting nerve growth, improving heart function, suppressing appetite, delaying gastric emptying, regulating blood lipid metabolism and reducing fat deposition. Moreover, GLP-1RAs have neuroprotective, anti-infectious, cardiovascular protective, and metabolic regulatory effects, exhibiting good application prospects. Growing attention has been paid to the relationship between GLP-1RAs and tumorigenesis, development and prognosis in patient with T2DM. Here, we reviewed the therapeutic effects and possible mechanisms of action of GLP-1RAs in the nervous, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems and their correlation with metabolism, tumours and other diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduce cardiorenal outcomes. We performed a network meta-analysis to compare the effect on cardiorenal outcomes among GLP-1 RAs, SGLT-2 inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. We searched the PUBMED, Embase and Cochrane databases for relevant studies published up until 10 December 2021. Cardiovascular and renal outcome trials reporting outcomes on GLP-1RA, SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); other outcomes were cardiovascular and total death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), and renal outcome. Twenty-three trials enrolling a total number of 181,143 participants were included. DPP-4 inhibitors did not lower the risk of any cardiorenal outcome when compared with placebo and were associated with higher risks of MACE, HHF, and renal outcome when compared with the other two drug classes. SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly reduced cardiovascular (RR = 0.88) and total (RR = 0.87) death, as compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, while GLP-1 RA reduced total death only (RR = 0.87). The comparison between GLP-1RA and SGLT-2 inhibitors showed no difference in their risks of MACE, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, CV and total death; SGLT-2 inhibitors were superior to GLP-1RA in reducing the risk of HHF and the renal outcome (24% and 22% lower risk, respectively). Only GLP-1RA reduced the risk of nonfatal stroke (RR = 0.84), as compared with placebo. There was no head-to-head trial directly comparing these antidiabetic drug classes. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RA are superior to DPP-4 inhibitors in reducing the risk of most cardiorenal outcomes; SGLT-2 inhibitors are superior to GLP-1RA in reducing the risk of HHF and renal events; GLP-1RA only reduced the risk of nonfatal stroke. Both SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RA should be the preferred treatment for type 2 diabetes and cardiorenal diseases.

      "Abstract: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are widely used due to their profound efficacy in glycemic control and weight management. Within real-world contexts, the manifestation of certain psychiatric adverse events (AEs) has been observed, which is potentially linked to the administration of GLP-1 RAs. The objective of this study was to undertake a comprehensive investigation and characterization of the psychiatric AEs associated with GLP-1 RAs. We retrieved reports of AEs associated with treatment with GLP-1 RAs during the period from the first quarter (Q1) of 2004 to Q1 2023 from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Descriptive analysis was performed to examine the clinical characteristics and time to onset of the psychiatric AEs caused by GLP-1 RAs. Moreover, disproportionality analyses were performed using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) to identify GLP-1 RA-related psychiatric AEs. A total of 8,240 reports of psychiatric AEs were analyzed out of 181,238 AE reports with treatment with GLP-1 RAs. Among these cases, a higher percentage was represented by women compared to men (65.89% vs. 30.96%). The median age of these patients was 56 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 48–67 years, based on data available in 286 case reports. This study showed that the median time to onset of the overall GLP-1 RA-related AEs was 31 days (IQR = 7–145.4 days), which varied among GLP-1 RA regimens. Specifically, exenatide had a significantly longer onset time at 45 days (IQR = 11–213 days), with statistically significant differences from the onset times of the other five GLP-1 RAs (p< 0.0001). Moreover, eight categories of psychiatric AEs, namely, nervousness (ROR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.85–2.11), stress (ROR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.19–1.38), eating disorder (ROR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.40–1.77), fear of injection (ROR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.60–2.40), sleep disorder due to general medical condition—insomnia type (ROR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.60–2.52), binge eating (ROR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.75–4.16), fear of eating (ROR 3.35, 95% CI = 1.65–6.78), and self-induced vomiting (ROR = 3.77, 95% CI = 1.77–8.03), were defined as GLP-1 RA-related psychiatric AEs through disproportionality analysis. Our findings demonstrate a significant association between GLP-1 RAs and the development of specific psychiatric AEs. Despite the observational nature of this pharmacovigilance study and the inherent limitations of the FAERS database, our preliminary findings in this work could provide a better basis for understanding the potential psychiatric AEs that may occur with GLP-1 RA treatment, assisting clinicians to focus on these AEs and provide early intervention for optimal risk management.\n",

      "Abstract: Due to their cardiovascular protective effect, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) represent breakthrough therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this review article, we discuss the mechanistic and clinical synergies that make the combined use of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is appealing in patients with T2DM. Overall, the presented cumulative evidence supports the benefits of GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy on metabolic-cardiovascular-renal disease in patients with T2DM, with a low hypoglycemia risk. Accordingly, we encourage the adoption of GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy in patients with T2DM and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (i.e., age ≥ 55 years, overweight/obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, current tobacco use, left ventricular hypertrophy, and/or proteinuria). Regarding renal effects, the evidence of SGLT2is in preventing kidney failure is more abundant than for GLP-1RAs, which showed a beneficial effect on albuminuria but not on hard kidney endpoints. Hence, in case of persistent albuminuria and/or uncontrolled metabolic risks (i.e., inadequate glycemic control, hypertension, overweight/obesity) on SGLT2i therapy, GLP-1RAs should be considered as the preferential add-on therapy in T2DM patients with chronic kidney disease. Despite the potential clinical benefits of GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy in patients with T2DM, several factors may delay this combination to become a common practice soon, such as reimbursement and costs associated with polypharmacy. Altogether, when administering GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy, it is important to adopt an individualized approach to therapy taking into account individual preferences, costs and coverage, toxicity profile, consideration of kidney function and glucose-lowering efficacy, desire for weight loss, and comorbidities.\n",

      "Abstract: Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are two incretins that bind to their respective receptors and activate the downstream signaling in various tissues and organs. Both GIP and GLP-1 play roles in regulating food intake by stimulating neurons in the brain’s satiety center. They also stimulate insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, but their effects on glucagon production in pancreatic α-cells differ, with GIP having a glucagonotropic effect during hypoglycemia and GLP-1 exhibiting glucagonostatic effect during hyperglycemia. Additionally, GIP directly stimulates lipogenesis, while GLP-1 indirectly promotes lipolysis, collectively maintaining healthy adipocytes, reducing ectopic fat distribution, and increasing the production and secretion of adiponectin from adipocytes. Together, these two incretins contribute to metabolic homeostasis, preventing both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, mitigating dyslipidemia, and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in individuals with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Several GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists have been developed to harness these pharmacological effects in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, with some demonstrating robust effectiveness in weight management and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Elucidating the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms could potentially usher in the development of new generations of incretin mimetics with enhanced efficacy and fewer adverse effects. The treatment guidelines are evolving based on clinical trial outcomes, shaping the management of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.\n",

In this cohort study of 125 474 patients initiating GLP-1 RAs, 46.5% of patients with and 64.8% without type 2 diabetes discontinued within 1 year; 47.3% of patients with and 36.3% without type 2 diabetes subsequently reinitiated a GLP-1 RA within 1 year. Weight loss, income, and adverse events were significantly associated with discontinuation, while weight regain was significantly associated with reinitiation. This study suggests that although most patients discontinue GLP-1 RAs, discontinuation rates are significantly higher and reinitiation rates are significantly lower for patients without type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "I've completed the research and created the final report on the safety and effectiveness of GLP-1 drugs for long-term use. The report addresses both aspects of your question:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Safety for Long-Term Use:**\n",
      "- Generally favorable safety profile supported by extensive clinical trial data\n",
      "- Common gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting) that typically diminish over time\n",
      "- Low risk of hypoglycemia due to glucose-dependent mechanism\n",
      "- Monitoring required for rare risks like pancreatitis and thyroid tumors\n",
      "- Real-world discontinuation rates due to side effects and cost considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "**Effectiveness for Long-Term Use:**\n",
      "- Strong evidence for sustained glycemic control over years of treatment\n",
      "- Durable weight loss maintained with continued treatment\n",
      "- Significant cardiovascular protection with progressive benefit accumulation\n",
      "- Benefits extend beyond primary indications to multiple organ systems\n",
      "- Evidence from both clinical trials and real-world studies\n",
      "\n",
      "The report provides a comprehensive analysis based on recent scientific literature, including mechanisms of action, safety considerations, efficacy evidence, and real-world usage patterns. The conclusion emphasizes that GLP-1RAs are effective long-term therapeutic agents when used appropriately with proper patient selection and monitoring.\n",
      "I've completed my research and analysis on the safety and effectiveness of GLP-1 drugs for long-term use. Based on current scientific literature and clinical evidence, here are the key findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Safety for Long-Term Use\n",
      "\n",
      "**Generally Favorable Profile:**\n",
      "- GLP-1 receptor agonists demonstrate good long-term safety supported by extensive clinical trial data\n",
      "- The glucose-dependent mechanism significantly reduces severe hypoglycemia risk compared to other diabetes medications\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Side Effects:**\n",
      "- Gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are most frequent but typically diminish with time and proper dose titration\n",
      "- These effects are dose-dependent and manageable with gradual dose increases\n",
      "\n",
      "**Long-Term Monitoring Considerations:**\n",
      "- Rare but important risks include potential pancreatitis and thyroid C-cell tumors (contraindicated with personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma)\n",
      "- Meta-analyses have not shown statistically significant increases in pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis with long-term use\n",
      "- Some muscle mass reduction during weight loss, though proportionally less than fat loss\n",
      "\n",
      "## Effectiveness for Long-Term Use\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strong Efficacy Evidence:**\n",
      "- **Glycemic Control:** Sustained HbA1c reductions maintained over years, with potential β-cell preservation\n",
      "- **Weight Management:** Clinically meaningful weight loss (15-20% in some patients) maintained with continued treatment\n",
      "- **Cardiovascular Benefits:** Significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events with progressive benefit accumulation over time\n",
      "\n",
      "**Durability of Effects:**\n",
      "- Unlike some diabetes medications, GLP-1RAs maintain effectiveness long-term rather than diminishing\n",
      "- Benefits extend beyond primary indications to cardiovascular protection, potential neuroprotection, and other metabolic improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "**Real-World Considerations:**\n",
      "- Discontinuation rates are notable (46.5% with diabetes, 64.8% without diabetes within first year) due to side effects, cost, or unmet expectations\n",
      "- Among patients who continue treatment, clinical trial benefits are generally maintained in real-world settings\n",
      "\n",
      "## Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence strongly supports GLP-1 receptor agonists as safe and effective for long-term use when properly managed. Success requires appropriate patient selection, gradual dose titration, ongoing monitoring for rare adverse events, and patient education about realistic expectations and the chronic nature of treatment. For suitable patients, these medications offer durable therapeutic benefits across multiple health domains that justify long-term use.\n",
