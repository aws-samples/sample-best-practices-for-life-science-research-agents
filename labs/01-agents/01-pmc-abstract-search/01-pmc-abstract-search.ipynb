    "# Use Tools to Search PubMed Central for Scientific Articles\n",
    "\n",
    "![Agent with scientific knowledge tool](../../../static/agent-tool-use.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab introduces participants to building their first research agent using the Strands Agents SDK and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. The lab emphasizes the importance of grounding AI agents with reliable data sources and demonstrates how proper tooling transforms unreliable responses into accurate, well-cited scientific information. It serves as a foundation for the more advanced retrieval and planning techniques covered in subsequent labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab starts by creating a basic agent using Claude Sonnet 4 and asking it about GLP-1 drug safety and effectiveness. This demonstrates a critical limitation: without access to real data, the agent generates plausible-sounding but potentially inaccurate PMC IDs that don't link to actual relevant articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab then introduces a custom `search_pmc` tool that connects to the PubMed Central API. This tool includes intelligent features like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtering for commercially licensed articles\n",
    "- Ranking results by citation count to prioritize high-impact research\n",
    "- Providing accurate PMC IDs that link to real, relevant scientific papers\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab guides participants through deploying their agent to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime, transforming a local prototype into a scalable, production-ready system. This includes configuring the runtime environment, launching the agent, and testing it in the cloud.\n",

Additionally, AgentCore Runtime supports extended execution times up to 8 hours, processes large 100MB payloads for multimodal workloads, and provides consumption-based pricing that charges only for resources actually used, making it ideal for complex research agents that require long-running sessions and comprehensive data processing capabilities.\n",
