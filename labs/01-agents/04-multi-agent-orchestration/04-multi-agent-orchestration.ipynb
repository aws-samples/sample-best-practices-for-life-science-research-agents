    "2. Lead agent decomposes question and creates research plan with multiple tasks\n",
    "3. Lead agent calls research agent with task 1 instructions\n",
    "4. Research agent examines task 1 instructions\n",
    "5. Research agent calls `search_pmc` and `gather_evidence` tools multiple times. Every time `gather_evidence` finishes, it saves the evidence gathered from a single PMC article to DynamoDB\n",
    "6. Research agent returns a task report with a summary and list of evidence id values\n",
    "7. Lead agent examines task report and updates research plan with information from research agent\n",
    "8. Repeat steps 3-7 for all tasks.\n",
    "9. Once research is complete, lead agent submits each section 1 summary and evidence to technical writing agent\n",
    "10. Technical writing agent retrieves evidence records from DynamoDB and submits section summary and evidence to Claude citation API\n",
    "11. Claude generates report section with inline citations\n",
    "12. Technical writing agent writes report section to file\n",
    "13. Technical writing agent reports completion to lead agent\n",

The primary adverse events reported are manageable gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting). Safety and tolerability were acceptable in clinical trials, though specific contraindications were not detailed in the excerpt.',\n",
       "   '**Long‑term safety profile and effectiveness**\\n\\n- **Effectiveness:**  \\n  - GLP‑1‑based agents (both single‑agonist and dual/triple agonists) consistently improve glycaemic control (↓ HbA1c) and produce substantial weight loss in people with type\\u202f2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity.  \\n  - In phase‑II/III trials, tirzepatide and the triple agonist retatrutide achieved >2\\u202f% absolute HbA1c reductions and 10‑15\\u202f% body‑weight loss over 24‑36\\u202fweeks, with durable benefits that persist into longer‑term follow‑up.  \\n  – Small‑molecule oral GLP‑1RAs such as orforglipron have shown dose‑dependent weight loss (≈9‑15\\u202f% over 26‑36\\u202fweeks) and A1c reductions (~2\\u202f%) comparable to injectable agents.\\n\\n- **Overall safety:**  \\n  - The safety record of GLP‑1‑RAs is considered acceptable for chronic use.  Most adverse events are mild‑to‑moderate, occur early in therapy, and tend to lessen with continued treatment.  \\n  - No severe hypoglycaemia or drug‑related deaths have been reported in the large phase‑III programs for tirzepatide or retatrutide.  \\n  - Long‑term data (up to several years for approved agents) show sustained efficacy without emergence of new organ‑specific toxicities, but continued pharmacovigilance is required, especially for newer dual/triple agonists.\\n\\n**Main adverse events (AEs)**  \\n\\n| System | Typical AEs (frequency) | Comments |\\n|--------|--------------------------|----------|\\n| **Gastro‑intestinal** | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, dyspepsia | Most common; usually transient, highest during dose‑escalation; dose‑dependent. |\\n| **Pancreatic** | Mild elevations of amylase/lipase; rare pancreatitis reports | Not prominent in the cited trials, but remains a class‑wide safety focus. |\\n| **Gallbladder** | Biliary colic, cholelithiasis (observed with some GLP‑1RAs) | Not highlighted in the excerpt but recognized in broader literature. |\\n| **Cardiovascular** | Generally neutral or beneficial (improved risk factors) | Tirzepatide showed positive impact on CV risk markers. |\\n| **Injection‑site reactions** (for peptide agents) | Redness, bruising | Minimal; oral small‑molecule agents avoid this. |\\n| **Severe hypoglycaemia** | Rare/absent in trials | GLP‑1RAs alone have low intrinsic hypoglycaemia risk; risk rises when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas. |\\n\\n**Contra‑indications / cautions for long‑term use**\\n\\n1. **Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type\\u202f2 (MEN\\u202f2).**  \\n   - GLP‑1RAs are contraindicated because of rodent data showing C‑cell hyperplasia; the label carries this warning for all agents in the class.\\n\\n2. **History of severe gastrointestinal disease** (e.g., gastroparesis, inflammatory bowel disease flare).  \\n   - Because GLP‑1RAs delay gastric emptying, they can exacerbate these conditions.\\n\\n3. **Pancreatitis** (active or recent).  \\n   - Although not definitively proven, clinicians avoid initiating GLP‑1RAs in patients with current pancreatitis.\\n\\n4. **Pregnancy & lactation** (insufficient data).  \\n   - Most agents are not recommended unless benefits outweigh potential risks.\\n\\n5. **Severe renal impairment** (eGFR\\u202f<\\u202f30\\u202fmL/min/1.73\\u202fm²) for certain agents.  \\n   - Dose adjustments or avoidance may be required; some newer agents have more permissive labeling.\\n\\n6. **Concurrent use of drugs that strongly delay gastric emptying** (e.g., high‑dose opioids) may increase GI side‑effects.\\n\\n**Practical take‑aways for clinicians**\\n\\n- **Start low, go slow:** Gradual dose escalation mitigates nausea/vomiting and improves tolerability.  \\n- **Monitor:** Periodic assessment of GI symptoms, pancreatic enzymes (if clinically indicated), and thyroid status in at‑risk patients.  \\n- **Educate patients:** Expect transient nausea; adherence improves once the body adapts.  \\n- **Consider oral small‑molecule GLP‑1RAs** (e.g., orforglipron) for patients averse to injections, but recognize that long‑term safety data are still emerging.  \\n\\nOverall, GLP‑1 receptor agonists provide durable glycaemic and weight benefits with a safety profile dominated by manageable gastrointestinal effects; contraindications are limited to specific endocrine, gastrointestinal, and renal conditions. Ongoing post‑marketing surveillance will continue to refine the long‑term risk‑benefit picture, especially for newer dual‑ and triple‑agonist formulations.',\n",
       "   'The excerpt highlights expanding GLP‑1RA indications and ongoing research, noting that combination therapies (e.g., semaglutide\\u202f+\\u202fcagrilintide) may reduce side‑effects and that new formulations aim to improve compliance, but it does not provide detailed long‑term safety data, specific adverse events, or contraindications.',\n",

Management emphasizes comprehensive patient education, initiating treatment with low starting doses, and implementing gradual dose titration to minimize adverse events (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). Dietary adjustments and ongoing monitoring are also essential components of the management approach (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2).\\n\\nRegarding clinical experience with long-term safety, GI adverse events occur in 40-85% of patients receiving GLP-1 RAs, but these events are typically mild and transient in nature (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). The adverse events generally resolve following dose escalation, indicating that patients can adapt to therapy over time (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). \\n\\nLong-term safety data demonstrate a favorable profile, with most events classified as non-serious and low rates of permanent treatment discontinuation (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). This clinical experience supports the overall safety profile of GLP-1 RAs for long-term use (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2).
