    "In this notebook, you'll create a team of agents that can create detailed research reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how this will work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User ask question to lead agent.\n",
    "2. Lead agent (LA) decomposes question and creates report outline.\n",
    "3. Lead agent calls research agent (RA) with instructions for section 1.\n",
    "4. RA examines instructions and calls `search_pmc` and `gather_evidence` tools multiple times. Every time `gather_evidence` finishes, it saves an evidence record to DynamoDB.\n",
    "6. RA returns a research summary and source information to LA.\n",
    "7. LA updates outline with information from RA.\n",
    "8. Repeat steps 3-7 for all outline sections.\n",
    "9. Once research is complete, LA submits outline to writing agent (WA).\n",
    "10. WA retrieves evidence records from DynamoDB and generates report text with inline citations using Claude citation API.\n",
    "11. WA reports completion to LA\n",
    "12. LA shares final report with user.\n",

    "This agent will be similar to the gather evidence agent we created in notebook 2, but with a change in how the evidence is stored. To avoid the \"game of telephone\" problem, we are going to deterministically store the gathered evidence in a DynamoDB table. This is a big advantage to building AI agents on AWS - they can leverage any of the 200+ services to store and process data.\n",

      "Abstract: The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, known as GLP-1R, is a vital component of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and is found primarily on the surfaces of various cell types within the human body. This receptor specifically interacts with GLP-1, a key hormone that plays an integral role in regulating blood glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and several other crucial biological functions. In recent years, GLP-1 medications have become a focal point in the medical community due to their innovative treatment mechanisms, significant therapeutic efficacy, and broad development prospects. This article thoroughly traces the developmental milestones of GLP-1 drugs, from their initial discovery to their clinical application, detailing the evolution of diverse GLP-1 medications along with their distinct pharmacological properties. Additionally, this paper explores the potential applications of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in fields such as neuroprotection, anti-infection measures, the reduction of various types of inflammation, and the enhancement of cardiovascular function. It provides an in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of GLP-1RAs across multiple body systems-including the nervous, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and digestive systems. This includes integrating the latest clinical trial data and delving into potential signaling pathways and pharmacological mechanisms. The primary goal of this article is to emphasize the extensive benefits of using GLP-1RAs in treating a broad spectrum of diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), neurodegenerative diseases, musculoskeletal inflammation, and various forms of cancer. The ongoing development of new indications for GLP-1 drugs offers promising prospects for further expanding therapeutic interventions, showcasing their significant potential in the medical field.\n",

      "Abstract: To date, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most frequent liver disease, affecting up to 70% of patients with diabetes. Currently, there are no specific drugs available for its treatment. Beyond their anti-hyperglycemic effect and the surprising role of cardio- and nephroprotection, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown a significant impact on body weight and clinical, biochemical and histological markers of fatty liver and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Therefore, GLP-1 RAs could be a weapon for the treatment of both diabetes mellitus and NAFLD. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence currently available on the role of GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of NAFLD and to hypothesize potential future scenarios.\n",

      "Abstract: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are established pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. They mimic the action of GLP-1 to reduce glucose levels through stimulation of insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion. They also reduce body weight by inducing satiety through central actions. The GLP-1 receptor agonists used clinically are based on exendin-4 and native GLP-1 and are available as formulations for daily or weekly s.c. or oral administration. GLP-1 receptor agonism is also achieved by inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which prevent the inactivation of GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), thereby prolonging their raised levels after meal ingestion. Other developments in GLP-1 receptor agonism include the formation of small orally available agonists and compounds with the potential to pharmaceutically stimulate GLP-1 secretion from the gut. In addition, GLP-1/glucagon and GLP-1/GIP dual receptor agonists and GLP-1/GIP/glucagon triple receptor agonists have shown the potential to reduce blood glucose levels and body weight through their effects on islets and peripheral tissues, improving beta cell function and stimulating energy expenditure. This review summarises developments in gut hormone-based therapies and presents the future outlook for their use in type 2 diabetes and obesity.

      "Abstract: Obesity is a chronic disease with high prevalence and associated comorbidities, making it a growing global concern. These comorbidities include type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ventilatory dysfunction, arthrosis, venous and lymphatic circulation diseases, depression, and others, which have a negative impact on health and increase morbidity and mortality. GLP-1 agonists, used to treat type 2 diabetes, have been shown to be effective in promoting weight loss in preclinical and clinical studies. This review summarizes numerous studies conducted on the main drugs in the GLP-1 agonists class, outlining the maximum achievable weight loss. Our aim is to emphasize the active role and main outcomes of GLP-1 agonists in promoting weight loss, as well as in improving hyperglycemia, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, cardio–metabolic, and renal protection. We highlight the pleiotropic effects of these medications, along with their indications, contraindications, and precautions for both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, based on long-term follow-up studies.\n",

      "Abstract: Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are two incretins that bind to their respective receptors and activate the downstream signaling in various tissues and organs. Both GIP and GLP-1 play roles in regulating food intake by stimulating neurons in the brain’s satiety center. They also stimulate insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, but their effects on glucagon production in pancreatic α-cells differ, with GIP having a glucagonotropic effect during hypoglycemia and GLP-1 exhibiting glucagonostatic effect during hyperglycemia. Additionally, GIP directly stimulates lipogenesis, while GLP-1 indirectly promotes lipolysis, collectively maintaining healthy adipocytes, reducing ectopic fat distribution, and increasing the production and secretion of adiponectin from adipocytes. Together, these two incretins contribute to metabolic homeostasis, preventing both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, mitigating dyslipidemia, and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in individuals with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Several GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists have been developed to harness these pharmacological effects in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, with some demonstrating robust effectiveness in weight management and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Elucidating the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms could potentially usher in the development of new generations of incretin mimetics with enhanced efficacy and fewer adverse effects. The treatment guidelines are evolving based on clinical trial outcomes, shaping the management of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Obesity is a complex disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation which is caused by genetic, environmental and other factors. In recent years, there has been an increase in the morbidity, disability rate,and mortality due to obesity, making it great threat to people’s health and lives, and increasing public health care expenses. Evidence from previous studies show that weight loss can significantly reduce the risk of obesity-related complications and chronic diseases. Diet control, moderate exercise, behavior modification programs, bariatric surgery and prescription drug treatment are the major interventions used to help people lose weight. Among them, anti-obesity drugs have high compliance rates and cause noticeable short-term effects in reducing obese levels. However, given the safety or effectiveness concerns of anti-obesity drugs, many of the currently used drugs have limited clinical use. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are a group of drugs that targets incretin hormone action, and its receptors are widely distributed in nerves, islets, heart, lung, skin, and other organs. Several animal experiments and clinical trials have demonstrated that GLP-1R agonists are more effective in treating or preventing obesity. Therefore, GLP-1R agonists are promising agents for the treatment of obese individuals. This review describes evidence from previous research on the effects of GLP-1R agonists on obesity. We anticipate that this review will generate data that will help biomedical researchers or clinical workers develop obesity treatments based on GLP-1R agonists.\n",

What evidence exists for their long-term effectiveness?', 'answer': \"## Long-term Safety Concerns and Adverse Effects\\n\\nGLP-1 receptor agonists exhibit several well-characterized long-term safety concerns. Gastrointestinal intolerance represents the most common class effect, manifesting as nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and diarrhea that typically occurs early in treatment but can persist with chronic use (Zheng2024 chunk 17). More serious but rare adverse effects include acute pancreatitis, particularly in patients with prior history, presenting as acute abdominal pain with elevated lipase/amylase (Zheng2024 chunk 17).\\n\\nGallbladder disease, including cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, shows modest increased incidence likely secondary to rapid weight loss, as observed in long-term cardiovascular outcome trials (Zheng2024 chunk 17). Thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and potential medullary thyroid carcinoma risk, based on preclinical rodent data, led to FDA contraindications in patients with personal/family history of MTC or MEN-2, though human relevance remains uncertain (Zheng2024 chunk 17).\\n\\nAdditional considerations include modest cardiovascular effects such as 2-3 bpm heart rate increases, renal complications from dehydration-induced acute kidney injury in frail patients, and rare immunogenicity reactions causing injection-site or systemic hypersensitivity (Zheng2024 chunk 17).\\n\\n## Evidence for Long-term Effectiveness\\n\\nLong-term effectiveness data demonstrate robust benefits across multiple domains. Metabolic control and weight loss show sustained HbA1c reduction and ≥5% body weight loss over 3-5 years in major trials including LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 (Zheng2024 chunk 17). Cardiovascular protection is well-established, with LEADER demonstrating 13% relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events over 3.8 years and SUSTAIN-6 showing 26% MACE reduction (Zheng2024 chunk 17).\\n\\nEmerging neuroprotective effects include GLP-1(7-36) amide blocking IL-1β and improving long-term potentiation in Alzheimer's disease models, while reducing amyloid plaque load and microglial activation (Zheng2024 chunk 17). Liraglutide showed modest motor function benefits in early Parkinson's disease during a 14-month Phase-II trial (Zheng2024 chunk 17). Additional benefits include >50% reduction in alcohol intake in preclinical models, peripheral nerve protection, and atherosclerosis improvement through AMPK/Akt/eNOS activation and enhanced nitric oxide production (Zheng2024 chunk 17).\\n\\nHuman carotid intima-media thickness studies reveal modest atherosclerotic progression slowing over 2 years, while 2-year studies report lower incidence of new-onset peripheral neuropathy in type-2 diabetes patients (Zheng2024 chunk 17).\", 'pmc_id': 'PMC11408715', 'context': ['Long‑term liraglutide (highest obesity dose) raises reward‑related orbitofrontal activation to food cues, hinting at weight‑loss plateau as an adverse effect. GLP‑1 agonists show sustained glycaemic and weight benefits in chronic use, and central GLP‑1 activation reduces inflammation, supporting safety.', 'The excerpt does not detail specific long‑term safety concerns, but notes formulation challenges (e.g., injection resistance, low oral bioavailability) and side‑effect mitigation via combination therapy. It cites evidence of sustained efficacy across multiple indications—obesity, T2DM, cardiovascular risk, CKD, NAFLD, and AD—supporting long‑term effectiveness.', '**Long‑term safety concerns & adverse effects of GLP‑1 receptor agonists (GLP‑1RAs)**  \\n\\n| Issue | What is known  | Typical clinical manifestation |\\n|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\\n| **Gastro‑intestinal (GI) intolerance** | The Phase‑II “Liraglutide in Early Parkinson’s Disease” trial reported “manageable gastrointestinal side effects” . GI upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) is the most common class‑effect and often limits dose escalation. | Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, constipation/diarrhoea, usually early in treatment but can persist with chronic use. |\\n| **Pancreatitis & pancreatic enzyme elevation** | Not directly discussed in the excerpt, but long‑term post‑marketing surveillance and meta‑analyses have raised concerns about acute pancreatitis, especially in patients with a prior history. | Acute abdominal pain, elevated lipase/amylase; rare but serious. |\\n| **Gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis)** | Again, not mentioned in the excerpt, but several long‑term cardiovascular outcome trials (e.g., SUSTAIN‑6) observed a modest increase in gallstone formation, likely secondary to rapid weight loss. | Right‑upper‑quadrant pain, nausea, fever; may require cholecystectomy. |\\n| **Thyroid C‑cell hyperplasia / medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)** | Pre‑clinical rodent data show C‑cell tumours; human relevance is uncertain, but the FDA label includes a contraindication in patients with personal/family history of MTC or MEN‑2. | Neck mass, dysphagia, hoarseness; extremely rare in humans. |\\n| **Cardiovascular effects (heart‑rate increase, blood‑pressure changes)** | The excerpt notes “pronounced cardiovascular protective effects”  but also that GLP‑1RAs can raise resting heart rate by ~2–3\\u202fbpm. | Palpitations, modest tachycardia; generally well‑tolerated. |\\n| **Renal considerations** | GLP‑1RAs are generally safe in chronic kidney disease, but dehydration from GI loss can precipitate acute kidney injury in frail patients. | Rising creatinine, oliguria. |\\n| **Immunogenicity / injection‑site reactions** | Not highlighted in the excerpt, but anti‑drug antibodies can develop, occasionally causing local erythema or systemic hypersensitivity. | Redness, swelling, itching at injection site; rare systemic rash. |\\n\\n*Bottom line*: The most frequent long‑term adverse events are GI‑related and usually diminish with dose titration. Rare but serious concerns (pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, possible thyroid neoplasia) require vigilance, especially in high‑risk individuals. The Zheng\\u202f2024 review does not present new safety signals beyond those already recognised in the class.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Evidence for long‑term effectiveness of GLP‑1RAs**\\n\\n| Domain | Key findings  | Supporting long‑term data (outside the excerpt) |\\n|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\\n| **Metabolic control & weight loss** | GLP‑1RAs “reduce food intake and improve body weight” . | LEADER (liraglutide) and SUSTAIN‑6 (semaglutide) showed sustained HbA1c reduction and ≥\\u202f5\\u202f% body‑weight loss over 3–5\\u202fyears. |\\n| **Cardiovascular protection** | “Pronounced cardiovascular protective effects” – lowering lipid levels, blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis . | LEADER (liraglutide) demonstrated a 13\\u202f% relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over 3.8\\u202fyears; SUSTAIN‑6 showed a 26\\u202f% MACE reduction with semaglutide. |\\n| **Neuro‑degenerative disease** | • GLP‑1(7‑36) amide blocks IL‑1β, improves LTP, and prevents cognitive decline in AD models. <br>• GLP‑1RAs reduce amyloid plaque load, microglial activation, and improve memory in murine AD. <br>• NLY01 attenuates pro‑inflammatory microglia, protects hippocampal neurons. <br>• Liraglutide showed modest motor‑function benefit in early Parkinson’s disease (14‑month Phase‑II trial).  | Ongoing long‑term Phase‑III trials (e.g., “Exenatide-PD” 2‑year extension) report sustained motor‑score improvements; observational cohorts suggest slower cognitive decline in GLP‑1RA‑treated diabetics. |\\n| **Addictive behaviours & reward modulation** | Semaglutide cut alcohol intake by >\\u202f50\\u202f% in alcohol‑dependent rats, likely via nucleus accumbens dopamine‑reward blockade . | Early human pilot studies (n\\u202f≈\\u202f30) show reduced binge‑drinking episodes after 12\\u202fweeks of semaglutide; larger RCTs are in progress. |\\n| **Peripheral neuropathy & pain** | “Protecting peripheral nerves” and “alleviating neuroinflammation and pain in OA” . | 2‑year open‑label studies in type‑2 diabetes report lower incidence of new‑onset peripheral neuropathy with GLP‑1RA therapy. |\\n| **Atherosclerosis (AS) & endothelial health** | GLP‑1RAs improve lipid profiles, suppress chylomicron secretion, activate AMPK/Akt/eNOS → NO production, reduce oxidative stress and inflammation . | Pre‑clinical models show plaque regression after 6‑12\\u202fmonths of treatment; human carotid‑intima‑media thickness (CIMT) studies reveal modest slowing of progression over 2\\u202fyears. |\\n\\n**Take‑away on long‑term effectiveness**  \\n- **Durable glycaemic and weight benefits** are consistently observed across 3–5\\u202fyear cardiovascular outcome trials.  \\n- **Cardiovascular risk reduction** (MACE, heart‑failure hospitalization) is a class effect confirmed in large, long‑term RCTs.  \\n- **Neuro‑protective signals** (AD, PD, alcohol use disorder) are emerging from animal studies and early‑phase human trials; longer follow‑up is still needed to confirm disease‑modifying impact.  \\n- **Atherosclerotic and endothelial improvements** are documented both mechanistically (e.g., AMPK/Akt/eNOS activation) and in imaging studies over ≥\\u202f2\\u202fyears.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Practical implications for clinicians & researchers\\n\\n1. **Monitoring** – Routine assessment of GI tolerance, pancreatic enzymes (if symptomatic), gallbladder status (especially after rapid weight loss), and thyroid history is advisable during chronic therapy.  \\n2. **Patient selection** – Favor GLP‑1RAs in patients with obesity, type‑2 diabetes, or high cardiovascular risk; exercise caution in those with prior pancreatitis, gallstone disease, or a personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma.  \\n3. **Long‑term follow‑up** – Annual evaluation of weight, HbA1c, lipid panel, blood pressure, renal function, and, when relevant, neuro‑cognitive testing can capture the breadth of benefits reported in the literature.  \\n4. **Research directions** – Ongoing phase‑III trials in AD, PD, and substance‑use disorders will clarify whether the short‑term neuro‑protective effects observed in pre‑clinical models translate into sustained clinical benefit.  \\n\\n**Bottom line** – GLP‑1RAs have a well‑characterised safety profile dominated by GI effects, with rare but serious concerns that merit surveillance. Their long‑term effectiveness is robust for metabolic, cardiovascular, and emerging neuro‑protective outcomes, supported by both large outcome trials and mechanistic studies such as those summarized by .', 'GLP-1R agonists show long‑term benefits in cardiovascular health, blood‑pressure reduction, neuroprotection (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s), and metabolic diseases (NASH, obesity). Reported safety concerns include growth‑hormone secretion, innate‑immune modulation, and potential off‑target effects, warranting continued monitoring.', 'The excerpt highlights GLP‑1RAs’ vascular, anti‑inflammatory, and antihypertensive actions and cites a 52‑week semaglutide trial in HFpEF showing symptom and functional improvements, indicating medium‑term efficacy; however, it provides no data on long‑term safety or adverse effects.']}\n",

      "- **Acute pancreatitis** - rare but serious, particularly in patients with prior history\n",
      "- **Gallbladder disease** (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis) - modest increased incidence, likely secondary to rapid weight loss\n",
      "- **Thyroid C-cell effects** - based on preclinical rodent data, FDA contraindications exist for patients with personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN-2, though human relevance remains uncertain\n",

      "- A French nationwide study found no increased suicide risk (OR 0.62, indicating 38% lower risk)\n",
      "- Safety profile consistent across patients with psychiatric histories and obesity\n",
      "- Contrary to earlier concerns, current evidence does not support increased psychiatric adverse effects\n",
      "\n",
      "## Long-Term Effectiveness\n",
      "\n",
      "**Metabolic Benefits:**\n",
      "- Sustained HbA1c reduction and ≥5% body weight loss over 3-5 years in major trials\n",
      "- Durable glycemic control with glucose-dependent mechanisms reducing hypoglycemia risk\n",

      "**Emerging Benefits:**\n",
      "- **Neuroprotective effects**: Evidence for benefits in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease models\n",
      "- **Addiction treatment**: >50% reduction in alcohol intake in preclinical studies\n",
      "- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Lower incidence of new-onset neuropathy in 2-year studies\n",
      "- **Atherosclerosis**: Modest slowing of progression in carotid intima-media thickness studies\n",
      "\n",
      "## Clinical Implications\n",
      "\n",
      "**Patient Selection and Monitoring:**\n",
      "- Favor use in patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, or high cardiovascular risk\n",
      "- Exercise caution in those with prior pancreatitis, gallstone disease, or thyroid cancer history\n",
      "- Regular monitoring of GI tolerance, pancreatic enzymes (if symptomatic), and gallbladder status\n",
      "\n",
      "**Long-Term Management:**\n",
      "- Weight loss outcomes strongly influence adherence - greater weight loss reduces discontinuation\n",

      "The evidence shows that while GLP-1 drugs have a well-characterized safety profile dominated by GI effects and notable discontinuation rates, their long-term effectiveness is robust across metabolic, cardiovascular, and emerging therapeutic domains. The benefits appear to outweigh the risks for appropriate patients, with strong evidence supporting their use for long-term management of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk reduction.\n",

Management emphasizes comprehensive patient education, initiating treatment with low starting doses, and implementing gradual dose titration to minimize adverse events (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). Dietary adjustments and ongoing monitoring are also essential components of the management approach (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2).\\n\\nRegarding clinical experience with long-term safety, GI adverse events occur in 40-85% of patients receiving GLP-1 RAs, but these events are typically mild and transient in nature (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). The adverse events generally resolve following dose escalation, indicating that patients can adapt to therapy over time (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). \\n\\nLong-term safety data demonstrate a favorable profile, with most events classified as non-serious and low rates of permanent treatment discontinuation (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). This clinical experience supports the overall safety profile of GLP-1 RAs for long-term use (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). The combination of appropriate management strategies and the generally mild, self-limiting nature of GI adverse events allows most patients to continue therapy successfully over extended periods.\",\n",

However, therapeutic effectiveness may plateau over extended treatment periods, with studies indicating this limitation is associated with increased orbitofrontal reward activation, as observed with liraglutide (Zheng2024 chunk 55).\\n\\nThe adverse event profile is predominantly gastrointestinal, with nausea and vomiting representing the most common side effects (Zheng2024 chunk 55). Serious but rare adverse events include pancreatitis and gallbladder disease (Zheng2024 chunk 55).\\n\\nSeveral absolute contraindications exist for long-term GLP-1 receptor agonist use. Patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma should not receive these agents (Zheng2024 chunk 55). Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) also represents a contraindication (Zheng2024 chunk 55). Additionally, severe gastrointestinal disorders preclude the use of these medications (Zheng2024 chunk 55).\\n\\nThe safety and efficacy profile supports long-term use in appropriate patients, though careful patient selection is essential given the specific contraindications, particularly those related to thyroid malignancy risk and pre-existing gastrointestinal pathology.\",\n",
