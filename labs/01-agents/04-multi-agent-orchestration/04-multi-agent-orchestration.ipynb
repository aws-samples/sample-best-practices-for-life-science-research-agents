While this dual agonist represents an advancement in the GLP-1 therapeutic class with unmatched effectiveness regarding glycemic control and body weight reduction, comprehensive long-term safety data beyond one year and broader evidence across the entire class of GLP-1 receptor agonists would be needed for a more complete assessment of long-term safety and efficacy (Nauck2022 chunk 2).\",\n",

Management emphasizes comprehensive patient education, initiating treatment with low starting doses, and implementing gradual dose titration to minimize adverse events (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). Dietary adjustments and ongoing monitoring are also essential components of the management approach (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2).\\n\\nRegarding clinical experience with long-term safety, GI adverse events occur in 40-85% of patients receiving GLP-1 RAs, but these events are typically mild and transient in nature (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). The adverse events generally resolve following dose escalation, indicating that patients can adapt to therapy over time (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). \\n\\nLong-term safety data demonstrate a favorable profile, with most events classified as non-serious and low rates of permanent treatment discontinuation (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2). This clinical experience supports the overall safety profile of GLP-1 RAs for long-term use (Gorgojo2023 chunk 2).

Serious but rare adverse events include pancreatitis and gallbladder disease (Zheng2024 chunk 55).\\n\\nSeveral absolute contraindications exist for long-term GLP-1 receptor agonist use. Patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma should not receive these agents (Zheng2024 chunk 55). Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) also represents a contraindication (Zheng2024 chunk 55). Additionally, severe gastrointestinal disorders preclude the use of these medications (Zheng2024 chunk 55).\\n\\nThe safety and efficacy profile supports long-term use in appropriate patients, though careful patient selection is essential given the specific contraindications, particularly those related to thyroid malignancy risk and pre-existing gastrointestinal pathology.\",\n",
