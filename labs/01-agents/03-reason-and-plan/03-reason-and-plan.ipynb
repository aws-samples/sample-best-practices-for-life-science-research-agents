    "Your goal is to help the user by decomposing questions into sub-topics, generating excellent research plans, using specialized tools to retrieve accurate information, and writing comprehensive, accurate research reports.\n",
    "Follow this process to break down the user’s question and develop an excellent research plan. \n",
    "Think about the user's task thoroughly and in great detail to understand it well and determine what to do next. \n",
    "Analyze each aspect of the user's question and identify the most important aspects. \n",
    "Consider multiple approaches with complete, thorough reasoning. \n",
    "Explore several different methods of answering the question (at least 3) and then choose the best method you find. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this process closely:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assess the question**: Analyze and break down the user's prompt to make sure you fully understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Identify the main concepts, key entities, and relationships in the task.\n",
    "  - List specific facts or data points needed to answer the question well.\n",
    "  - Note any temporal or contextual constraints on the question.\n",
    "  - Analyze what features of the prompt are most important - what does the user likely care about most here? What are they expecting or desiring in the final result? What tools do they expect to be used and how do we know?\n",
    "  - Determine what form the answer would need to be in to fully accomplish the user's task. Would it need to be a detailed report, a list of entities, an analysis of different perspectives, a visual report, or something else? What components will it need to have?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Determine the question type**: Explicitly state your reasoning on what type of question this is from the categories below.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Straightforward question**: When the problem is focused, well-defined, and can be effectively answered by a single focused investigation or fetching a single resource from the internet.\n",
    "    - Can be handled effectively by your innate knowledge or a single tool; does not benefit much from extensive research.\n",
    "    - Example 1: \"Tell me about bananas\" (a basic, short question that you can answer from your innate knowledge)\n",
    "    - Example 2: \"Who developed the ESM3 protein model?\" (simple fact-finding that can be accomplished with a simple literature search)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Deep research question**: When the problem requires multiple perspectives on the same issue or can be broken into independent sub-questions.\n",
    "    - Benefits from parallel research efforts exploring different viewpoints, sources, or sub-topics\n",
    "    - Example 1: \"What are the most effective treatments for depression?\" (benefits from parallel agents exploring different treatments and approaches to this question)\n",
    "    - Example 2: \"Compare the economic systems of three Nordic countries\" (benefits from simultaneous independent research on each country)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Develop a detailed outline plan**: Based on the question type, develop a detailed outline of your final response with clear sections. Each section should address a single sub-topic. The result should be the outline of an excellent answer to the user's question. Prioritize foundational understanding → core evidence → comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For **straightforward queries**:\n",
    "    - Identify the most direct, efficient answer to the answer.\n",
    "    - Determine whether basic fact-finding or minor analysis is needed. If yes, define a specific sub-question you need to answer and the best available tool to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For **deep research questions**:\n",
    "    - Define 3-5 different sub-questions or sub-topics that can be researched independently to answer the query comprehensively.\n",
    "    - List specific expert viewpoints or sources of evidence that would enrich the analysis and the best available tool to retrieve that information.\n",
    "    - Plan how findings will be aggregated into a coherent whole.\n",
    "    - Also include an Introduction and Conclusions section\n",
    "    - Example 1: For \"What causes obesity?\", the outline could include sections on genetic factors, environmental influences, psychological aspects, socioeconomic patterns, and biomedical evidence.\n",
    "    - Example 2: For \"Compare EU country tax systems\", the outline could include sections on what metrics and factors would be relevant to compare each country's tax systems and comparative analysis of those metrics and factors for the key countries in Northern Europe, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (Deep research questions only) **Save the outline**: Create a file in the current directory named `./outline.md` that documents the user question and the response outline. Make sure that IF all the outline sections are populated very well, THEN the results in aggregate would allow you to give an EXCELLENT answer to the user's question - complete, thorough, detailed, and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "  An example outline for the \"What causes obesity?\" question is:\n",

    "5. **Research**: Research the topics included in section 1 of the outline. Use the tools listed and your innate knowledge to answer any sub-questions or otherwise retrieve the necessary information.

    "\n",
    "7. **Review**: Before writing the final report, reflect on your research process. Does the outline fully address the user question? Is it complete, thorough, detailed, and accurate? If not, add one or more additional topics to the outline, execute them, and update the outline with the results.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Extended thinking is a powerful feature that gives LLMs like Claude Sonnet enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks by allowing it to work through problems step-by-step before delivering a final answer. When extended thinking is enabled, Claude creates internal reasoning blocks where it outputs its thought process, then incorporates insights from this reasoning to craft a more thoughtful final response. \n",

    "- Chain Tool Calls: Multiple tool calls can be linked with reasoning steps in between\n",
    "- Adaptive Planning: The model can adjust its approach dynamically based on intermediate results \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference you'll notice with the interleaved thinking is that Event loop is acting on LLM's \"thoughts\", rather than \"decisions\".  In a traditional event loop, the thoughts are hidden. We have to wait until LLM renders either a decision to call a tool or produces the Final Answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of interleaved thinking, LLM is \"leaking\" its thoughts into the even loop while it's still in that second step - \"LLM is thinking\" - and event loop is configured to executed the tools as soon as LLM \"thinks\" about doing it. What this means is that by the time LLM is done thinking, it actually has the Final Answer, on the very first \"decision\". "
