# Best Practices for Life Science Research Agents on AWS

## Summary

Learn how to build and deploy AI agents for life science research. AI research agents speed up scientific discovery by planning research tasks, interacting with domain-specific tools and data, and generating detailed research reports. This hands-on workshop will cover current best practices for building AI research agents. Through interactive demonstrations and hands-on exercises, you'll learn how to use AWS services like Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and open source frameworks like Strands Agents to deploy AI research teams securely and at scale. Then, you'll experiment with scientific tools and databases to answer your own research questions. Whether you're hunting for the next blockbuster drug or pushing the boundaries of basic research, you'll leave equipped with practical skills to accelerate your scientific pipeline.
